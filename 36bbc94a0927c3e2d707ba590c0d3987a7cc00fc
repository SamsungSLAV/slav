Given how many projects use them I feel it would be best to go with the flow. I added two comments to point out how moving this to GH Issues could improve workflow. Let me know what you think!",

If a change is truly needed, I\u0027ll align relevant branches on both servers, merge the change (with fixes, if required) and realign branches again. Full migration seems like a too heavy investment\n\n\u003e And lastly - while I understand benefits of having roadmap in git, I think we have already in place a far better alternative - GitHub issues. Given how many projects use them I feel it would be best to go with the flow. I added two comments to point out how moving this to GH Issues could improve workflow. Let me know what you think!\n\nI like having roadmap simple, offline and migratable and GH Issues don\u0027t provide me the latter two afaik. Let\u0027s go with them anyway for the time being and see how well they\u0027ll fit",
