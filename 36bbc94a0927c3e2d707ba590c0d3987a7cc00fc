      "message": "As for the roadmap itself- as far as I understand the goal here is to showcase how SLAV can be used to test some targets, on the example of RISC-V Cyber Dryad.\nAs for other stuff that I\u0027d like to see - there are some patches that have been in limbo since 2018/2019, maybe we could bring them to merge/abandon?\nAnd lastly - while I understand benefits of having roadmap in git, I think we have already in place a far better alternative - GitHub issues. Given how many projects use them I feel it would be best to go with the flow. I added two comments to point out how moving this to GH Issues could improve workflow. Let me know what you think!",
