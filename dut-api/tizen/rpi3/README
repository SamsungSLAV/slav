*********************
Connecting with MuxPi
*********************


To use DUT API scripts, some connections must be made:

UART
----

You need to connect MuxPi's UART for DUT:
https://muxpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hw-overview.html#uart

with Raspberry Pi's UART - Pins 8, 10 on: https://pinout.xyz/#

POWER
-----

Please see the MuxPi documentation to locate the connecitons this section refers to.

https://muxpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hw-overview.html#other-connectors

Power should be controllable by MuxPi. You need to connect 5V power source to DUT Power IN.
Another connection should be between DUT power OUT and Raspberry Pi - you can either use MicroUSB
connector or the pin connectors. We use the Micro USB connector.

SD Card
-------

You will need a cable with a BLD10 connector on one side and a MicroSD card shaped board on the
other side.

You need to place a MicroSD card into MuxPi slot at the bottom of the board. Then you should
connect SD Adapter to Raspberry Pi's MicroSD slot.
