DUT API must be implemented on Dryads that are to be used by Weles.

DUT API is implemneted when Dryad has avaliable in PATH following scripts:
dut_boot.sh         - Should exit successfully when device is booted (ready for login)
dut_login.sh        - Currently unused - should take login information as arguments
dut_copyfrom.sh     - Copies $1 from DUT to $2 on Dryad/ Weles database mounted over sshfs
dut_copyto.sh       - Copies $1 from Dryad/ Weles database mounted over sshfs to $2
dut_exec.sh         - Executes command passed as argument on DUT


sections:

dut_boot

dut_login

dut_copyfrom

dut_copyto

dut_exec

defining for each:
what it does
arguments
when it should exit
exit codes
